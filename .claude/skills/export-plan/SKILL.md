# Export Plan Skill

Copy the plan from the most recent Plan agent output in this conversation into a markdown file at the project root called `PLAN.md`.

Add a `# Plan` heading at the top, then paste the plan content exactly as-is below it.

If there is no plan in the conversation, tell the user there is nothing to export.
